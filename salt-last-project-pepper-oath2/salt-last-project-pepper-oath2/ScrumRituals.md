# Templates for Scrum-rituals
This file contains descriptions of the Scrum rituals we will do during the last 2 weeks.

Here's the introduction to [Scrum and Agile](./presentations/AgileAndScrum.pdf), that Marcus presented in week 4 (or so) and here is the [Sprint Planning presentation](./presentations/SprintPlanning.pdf) .

## Sprint planning schedule

1. Create a product backlog
   1. You might want to create an impact map to easier find the things you need to
   2. At the very least create a list of things that might go into the product
   3. Sort it on value (for your customer/users).
      1. Use the Line-of-cards estimation technique for this
2. Once you have the backlog sorted in business value, let's create the Sprint backlog
   1. Discuss and document your definition of Done per feature
   2. Let's estimate the first couple (5-10) of cards on effort
      1. Use the planning poker technique for this
   3. Select the amount of features/cards you will finish in this sprint
   4. You might want to prepare a few more if you will need it
3. Let's prepare the Sprint
   1. Per feature on the Sprint backlog - define at least one Acceptance criteria
   2. Create the burndown chart in it's initial state (Story points on X-axis, days on the Y)
   3. Create the Scrum board (Todo, Doing, Done-columns will suffice for now)
   4. Only have 1 card at the same time in the Doing-column, mobs!

### Daily standup

The daily standup is used to check in on our progress and see if we need to adjust our work to make the time box.

In the daily standup

1. Check-in
   1. How are everyone doing
   2. How are we feeling about our progress
2. Check the board and talk about the priority and ongoing activity
   1. What can be moved
   2. What should change
   3. Is the board reflection what we really are doing
3. Update the burn down chart with your progress
4. Hop to work!

## Sprint review

The sprint review is done with the demonstration and retrospective.

You have done many of these already, so I will just [link to the retro-description](https://saltsthlm.github.io/retros/)
